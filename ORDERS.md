# Orders & Payments Feature

## Overview

The Belgrade Mama Marketplace now includes a complete order and payment management system that allows buyers to purchase items from listings and tracks the entire transaction lifecycle.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

Added two new models to the Prisma schema:

**Order Model:**
- Tracks order details including buyer information, delivery address, and order status
- Links to buyer (User), seller (User), and listing
- Supports multiple order statuses: PENDING, CONFIRMED, IN_DELIVERY, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
- Stores buyer contact information for easy communication

**Payment Model:**
- Tracks payment information including amount, method, and status
- Supports three payment methods: CARD, CASH, BANK_TRANSFER
- **Stores card number** (both full number and last 4 digits)
- Payment statuses: PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED, REFUNDED
- One-to-one relationship with Order

### 2. Backend API (`/apps/api/src/routes/orders.ts`)

**Endpoints:**

- `POST /orders` - Create a new order with payment information
  - Validates listing exists
  - Prevents self-purchase
  - Stores card number in database
  - Automatically extracts last 4 digits for display

- `GET /orders/my-purchases` - Get all orders where user is the buyer
  - Includes listing, payment, and seller information

- `GET /orders/my-sales` - Get all orders where user is the seller
  - Includes listing, payment, and buyer information

- `GET /orders/:id` - Get single order details
  - Access restricted to buyer or seller only

- `PATCH /orders/:id/status` - Update order status (seller only)
  - Allows seller to move order through workflow
  - Auto-sets completedAt timestamp when status is COMPLETED

- `PATCH /orders/:id/payment-status` - Update payment status (seller only)
  - Updates payment status and transaction ID
  - Auto-sets paidAt timestamp when status is COMPLETED

### 3. Frontend Pages

**Checkout Page (`/checkout/:listingId`):**
- Complete checkout form with buyer information
- Delivery address input (optional)
- Payment method selection (CARD, CASH, BANK_TRANSFER)
- **Card number input field** - stores full 16-digit card number
- Order summary with listing details
- Success confirmation screen

**Orders Page (`/orders`):**
- Tabbed interface: "My Purchases" and "My Sales"
- Full order history with filtering
- Status indicators with color coding
- Payment information including **last 4 digits of card**
- Contact information for buyer/seller
- Delivery details
- Seller actions to update order status
- Status workflow buttons (Confirm ‚Üí In Delivery ‚Üí Complete)

**Listing Detail Page:**
- Updated "Contact Seller" button to "Buy Now" button
- Links directly to checkout page

### 4. Navigation

Updated main navigation in Home.tsx to include:
- **üì¶ Orders** link in user menu
- Direct access to order management

## Card Number Storage

### Important: Security Consideration

‚ö†Ô∏è **The current implementation stores full card numbers in the database for demonstration purposes.**

**For Production:**
- **DO NOT** store full card numbers
- Integrate with a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, Square)
- Use tokenization for card data
- Store only last 4 digits and payment gateway tokens
- Ensure PCI DSS compliance

### Current Implementation

```typescript
// Payment model includes
cardNumber: String?       // Full card number (DEMO ONLY)
cardLastFour: String?     // Last 4 digits for display
```

**What gets stored:**
- During checkout, user enters 16-digit card number
- Backend extracts last 4 digits automatically
- Both full number and last 4 are stored in Payment table
- Frontend displays only last 4 digits in order history

**File: `/apps/api/src/routes/orders.ts:49-53`**
```typescript
const cardLastFour = data.payment.cardNumber
  ? data.payment.cardNumber.slice(-4)
  : undefined;
```

## Database Migration

To apply the new schema changes:

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL (if using Docker)
docker compose up -d

# Run migrations
cd apps/api
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_orders_and_payments

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

## Testing the Feature

1. **Create a listing** (as User A)
2. **Login as different user** (User B)
3. **Navigate to listing detail page**
4. **Click "Buy Now" button**
5. **Fill checkout form:**
   - Name, phone, email
   - Delivery address (optional)
   - Select payment method
   - **Enter card number** (e.g., 1234567890123456)
6. **Submit order**
7. **View order in "My Purchases" tab**
   - Check that card last 4 digits are displayed
8. **Login as seller (User A)**
9. **View order in "My Sales" tab**
   - Update order status through workflow
10. **Verify card number persisted** in database
